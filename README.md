**Official Notice: Prototype Version**

Dear Users,

Welcome to the Hotel Reservation System Prototype repository. This project serves as an initial prototype of a hotel reservation system implemented in Java. Please be informed that this version is a reference and a work in progress, representing the early stages of development. It is not intended for production use at this point.

**Important Information:**
- This prototype version is a simplified representation and lacks certain features essential for a fully functional hotel reservation system.
- Developers intending to use this prototype are encouraged to consider it as a starting point for their own development and customization.
- The prototype serves as a guide for understanding the basic structure and flow of a hotel reservation system implemented in Java.

**Developers and Contributors:**
- Developers are welcome to explore and contribute to this prototype. Suggestions, enhancements, and bug fixes are highly appreciated.
- If you are a developer or contributor, please fork the repository, create a new branch, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

**Future Development:**
The future development roadmap for this Hotel Reservation System includes, but is not limited to, the following plans:
- Implementation of advanced features such as user authentication, payment processing, and room availability tracking.
- Integration of a database system for persistent storage of reservation data.
- Development of a user-friendly and responsive front-end interface.
- Comprehensive testing, documentation, and optimization for performance and scalability.

We appreciate your interest in this prototype version. Please note that further development is underway to transform this Hotel Reservation System into a robust and feature-rich application.

Thank you for your understanding and collaboration.

Best regards,
